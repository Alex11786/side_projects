Part 1:
1. Connect all plugins/fonts/css/bootstrap links
2. Set the body's background color to pink
3. Start working on a navbar (create a nav container, a navbar-brand, a toggler
icon, and links that should collapse into a toggler button)
4. Working on CSS (changing the font in body, changin the navbar-brand and 
navLinks color and weight, adjusting paddings, overhauling buttons to the 
final solution)

Part 2:
Adjusting grid (alternating images and text "left and right")
5. Adding container-fluid, putting two 50/50 columns, deleting padding of 
container-fluid (adding class "px-0"), adding image to a second column with "img-fluid" class
6. Using flexbox-like properties to align "Museum Of Candy" sign to the left
of the picture, so it would be in the center of the column, using
align-items property.
7. To hide a "Museum of Candy" sign you need to wrap it in div to be able
to hide it.
8. Add another section similar to the previous one, to rearrange the order use order-1/order-2,
And adapt to size with order-lg-1/2 depending on whats going first/second before or after "responsiveness"
9. A little not-so-important tweaking, e.g. adding align-items-center to align items vertically,
justify-content-center to align horizontally, adding icon with classes :w-25 d-none d-lg-inline
to hide icon when the screen gets smaller, etc.
10. Adding css properties to make things prettier (font-weight/font-size/color/line-height/etc.)
11. Optionally add some not taken name in class structure, like "blurp/toto" to refer to it in css,
e.g. ".popo h2"
12. To add another section you can just duplicate html code of one section and adjust
accordingly.
13. To create margin between rows, give them a special unique class, like "content", and add margin
(e.g. mb-5 mb-lg-0) to every row with "content class".
14. Adding background color to navbar when scrolling down, with adding script tag at the bottom (for practices purpose):
<script>
    $(function () {
        $(document).scroll(function(){
            var $nav = $("#mainNav");
            $nav.toggleClass("scrolled", $(this).scrollTop() > $nav.height());
        })
    })
</script>
DONT FORGET TO INCLUDE JQUERY SCRIPT!
